# Machine Learning Course Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Course Repository! This repository contains all the resources, assignments, and project files for the machine learning course.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Dataset**: This folder contains all the datasets used throughout the course for assignments, projects, and practice exercises.
  
- **Homework**: This folder includes all the homework assignments. Each homework is in its own subfolder, with relevant instructions and required files.
  
- **Lecture**: This folder contains the lecture materials organized by topic. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific topic or module in the course. Click on each topic to navigate directly to its files:

  - [00_Image](Lecture/00_Image): Contains images that are referenced and used within the Jupyter notebooks and lecture notes.
  - [01_Mathematical_Foundations](Lecture/01_Mathematical_Foundations): Fundamental mathematical concepts needed for machine learning.
